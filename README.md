# Tumor-Detection
## Overview
This project focuses on brain tumor detection using deep learning techniques. It combines **ResNet50** for feature extraction with **Segment U-Net** for precise tumor segmentation. The model is trained on MRI scan datasets to identify and segment tumors accurately.

## Features
- **Hybrid Deep Learning Approach**: Uses ResNet50 for feature extraction and U-Net for segmentation.
- **Medical Image Analysis**: Applied to MRI scans for tumor detection.
- **Preprocessing & Augmentation**: Enhances dataset quality for better model performance.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assesses accuracy, precision, recall, and IoU metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset used is from Kaggleâ€™s **Healthcare AI Datasets - Brain MRI**. It includes MRI scans and corresponding tumor masks.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EekshithMandava/Tumor-Detection.git
   cd Tumor-Detection

And either upload it to Google Colab or use Jupyter Notebook
